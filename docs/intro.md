# Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

**Focus and Theme**: AI Systems in the Physical World. Embodied Intelligence.

**Goal**: Bridging the gap between the digital brain and the physical body. Students apply their AI knowledge to control Humanoid Robots in simulated and real-world environments.

## Why Physical AI Matters

Humanoid robots are poised to excel in our human-centered world because they share our physical form and can be trained with abundant data from interacting in human environments. This represents a significant transition from AI models confined to digital environments to **embodied intelligence** that operates in physical space.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will:

- ✅ Understand Physical AI principles and embodied intelligence
- ✅ Master ROS 2 (Robot Operating System) for robotic control
- ✅ Simulate robots with Gazebo and Unity
- ✅ Develop with NVIDIA Isaac AI robot platform
- ✅ Design humanoid robots for natural interactions
- ✅ Integrate GPT models for conversational robotics

## Course Structure

This capstone quarter is divided into **4 core modules**:

1. **Module 1**: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
2. **Module 2**: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
3. **Module 3**: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)
4. **Module 4**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Each module builds upon the previous, culminating in a **Capstone Project**: an autonomous humanoid robot that responds to voice commands, plans paths, navigates obstacles, and manipulates objects.
